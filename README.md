# PhAInomics.github.io
A suite of bleeding-edge Artificial Intelligence tools for Phenomics

The repository stores a collection of up-to-date tools and methods for morphological data extraction, processing and analysis using AI. 
Each tool is built to handle different functions, across a suite of programming languages and data types. Use the search bar and the tag system to navigate the repository. The repository is indexed by data types, programming languages, and functionality.
We also include tutorials on the use of individual tools and combinations of tools in the most applicable way to different types of studies of evolutionary morphology.
