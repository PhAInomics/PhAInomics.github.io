## Landmark-Free Analysis

Landmark-free methods capture phenotypic variation using dense surface data (e.g., meshes, voxel grids), bypassing the need for predefined anatomical landmarks. These methods are ideal for complex or morphologically variable taxa.

*Coming soon: deformation-based morphometry and 3D shape embeddings.*
