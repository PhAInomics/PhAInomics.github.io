## Discrete Traits

This section explores the use of AI in extracting and analyzing **discrete phenotypic traits** â€” binary or categorical features such as the presence/absence of a structure, number of limbs, or branching types. These traits often form the basis for comparative phylogenetic studies and evolutionary modeling.

AI models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are increasingly being used to automate the identification of these traits from complex biological imagery.
