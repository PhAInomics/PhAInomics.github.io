## Phenomics and AI

Phenomics is the study of phenotypes—the observable traits of an organism. In this section, we explore how AI-driven methods are transforming the analysis of phenotypic data. AI applications such as deep learning and machine vision allow researchers to identify and quantify phenotypic traits from complex biological images and datasets.

We discuss the role of AI in automating the analysis of phenotypes and the potential for AI to uncover new insights into how phenotypic variation evolves in response to environmental pressures.

Phenomics with AI is revolutionizing the way we understand the relationship between genotype and phenotype, making this an essential tool for evolutionary biology, ecology, and agriculture.
