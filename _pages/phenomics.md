## Phenomics in AI-Driven Research

**Phenomics** is the study of high-dimensional phenotypic variation within and across populations, and it plays a central role in understanding evolutionary biology. This page highlights how AI tools are helping researchers explore phenotypic traits, variations, and the high-dimensional phenotype. From extraction of discrete traits to pose estimations, AI-based methods are opening new frontiers in phenomics.

Learn how AI technologies are transforming the study and extraction of phenotypic data.
