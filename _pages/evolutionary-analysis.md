## Evolutionary Analysis with AI

AI is playing an increasingly important role in understanding evolutionary processes. This section explores how AI-driven techniques are being applied to study evolutionary patterns, track genetic variation, and predict adaptive responses to changing environments. 

From evolutionary tree reconstruction to the analysis of genetic drift and selection, AI tools help researchers unlock the mysteries of how species evolve over time. We examine how AI models are being used to simulate evolutionary processes, identify genomic signatures of adaptation, and predict phenotypic changes in response to environmental pressures.

By combining AI and evolutionary analysis, we can gain deeper insights into how organisms evolve and adapt to their environments, opening up new avenues for research in evolutionary biology and conservation.
