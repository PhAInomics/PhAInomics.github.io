## Evolutionary Analysis in AI-Driven Phenomics

**Evolutionary analysis** is the study of the mechanisms driving phenotypic changes over time. AI-based methods are becoming increasingly important for analyzing evolutionary traits in biological specimens. This page provides an overview of how AI technologies help researchers model and predict evolutionary trends, examining genetic, environmental, and morphological factors that drive phenotypic evolution.

Explore how AI is being applied to simulate evolutionary processes and enhance our understanding of the forces that shape species over time.
